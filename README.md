This application is used to track dungeons/trials/raids that are locked/unlocked.

You can download the DungeonSoup - Test.rar, this is the first public release.

You can clear your app.log if it still retains from my testing, and if there are some that still show as "unlocked" when you download it, you can get just click "reset" to reset the app to all being locked.

If you right click an item, you have the option to click "unlock" and "info", info contains an image with the quest name and location/npc in order to start the unlock of that duty.


I will update this app as new trials/dungeons/raids/expansions come out as best i can, for as long as i'm playing the game. if at any point i stop, I will attempt to hand off the app upkeep to another or look for a way to automate it.

I may add additional content to this over time. Such as Aether Currents, but I am undecided at this time.



Right now there are some bugs with opening the additional windows (select theme, etc...) where you can open multiple of the same window. and a bug with the scrollbar not updating appropriately, it does work, but visually doesn't update and resets to the top.
